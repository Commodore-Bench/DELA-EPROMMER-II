# DELA EPROMMER II

![](https://github.com/DL2DW/DELA-EPROMMER-II/blob/main/Images/DELA%20EPROMMER%20II.jpg)



Replica of the then quite popular EPROM burner "DELA EPROMMER II". From an old broken circuit board I designed this reconstruction. 

It can be burned in the original state with this programming adapter the EPROM types 2716 to 27256, as well as the CMOD variants of it.

With an appropriate modification you can then even program 27512 EPROMs.

The DELA EPROMMER II was at that time also my preferred way to program EPROMs. Unfortunately the original was destroyed by a too long storage in the cellar. But for reasons of nostalgia I have rebuilt the programming adapter once again.



# Building

The board is completely equipped with components for through-hole mounting, as it was back then. There are also no special requirements. The parts are all commercially available and still easy to get in any better sorted electronics store.

Even for beginners this board should not make any problems with mounting and soldering.

# BOM

Here is the list of components needed. I have chosen the manufacturers as examples. Of course, compatible components from other manufacturers can also be selected.
